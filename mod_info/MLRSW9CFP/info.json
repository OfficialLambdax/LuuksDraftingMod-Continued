It is time for drafting![\/B]\nWelcome to the first publicly available drafting mod for BeamNG.Drive!\nHave you ever wanted to try slipstreaming the driver ahead of you, and been severely disappointed? Have you ever wanted to go oval racing, but it's boring without drafting? Fear not, the drafting mod is here to save the day!\n\n[CENTER][IMG]https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/1104452581675237396\/1115340933257502750\/drafting.gif[\/IMG][IMG]https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/1104452581675237396\/1116022194129096704\/flyby_wind.gif[\/IMG][\/CENTER]\n\n[B][U]Mod features:[\/U][\/B]\n- [B]Singleplayer[\/B] AND [B]multiplayer[\/B] compatibility;\n- Semi-realistic drafting based on frontal area, velocity, angle, etc;\n- Works with all vanilla, modded and automation cars;\n- WIP side-drafting;\n\n[B][U]Want to support me?[\/U][\/B]\nI've set up a Ko-Fi if you want to support me in my modding journey!\n[URL]https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/lucky4luuk[\/URL]\nI also have a Discord server!\n[URL]https:\/\/discord.gg\/mVcQAR4CFH[\/URL]\n\n[B][U]Try my other mods too!

Fingers crossed this is the last big bug left :)\nv1.4: Multicar drafting majorly improved and added a \"hidden\" strength multiplier.\nv1.3: Fly-by wind effect and reasonably improved draft angle calculation.\nv1.2: Fixed multicar drafting and some MP-only bugs. Improved performance slightly.\nv1.1: Tweaked draft angle and strength at speed.\nv1.0: Initial version of the mod, not posted here.\n\n[CENTER][I]If you use this mod in any videos, I'd love to get credit!
