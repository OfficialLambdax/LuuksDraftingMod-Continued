# LuuksDraftingMod-Continued
Drafting mod for BeamNG.drive by Luuk

## Motivation
Luuk is taking a break from BeamNG and i, just as many others, consider their racing mods as must haves. As such i took it on me to continue their mods because they are very important bits for competitive multiplayer gameplay in BeamNG.

This is a fork of [Luuks Drafting Mod](https://www.beamng.com/resources/luuks-drafting-mod.26914) By [Lucky4Luuk](https://github.com/Lucky4Luuk)
